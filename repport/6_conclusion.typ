= Conclusion

In conclusion we completed one of the main research questions namely the clean spermatogenic trajectory (spermatogonia → spermatocytes → spermatids) and supporting somatic lineages for both scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. Both were done with two different methodologies scRNA-seq using gene markers of leiden clustering and SCVI-tools CellAssign model, scATAC-seq using ingesting scRNA-seq data and pycistopic workflow with label transfer from scRNA-seq data annotations.

Learned a lot about working with single cell data using python for analysis. As the project ran out of time, not all of the initial goals were completed.
